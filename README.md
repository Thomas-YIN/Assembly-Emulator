# Assembly Language Emulator

This repository is for the programming assignment2 in [COMP2012: Object-Oriented Programming and Data Structures](https://course.cse.ust.hk/comp2012/), HKUST. 

In this assignment, I implemented a system that is able to compile and execute assembly code. To run the program, run `./ pa2.exe` in the working directory.
